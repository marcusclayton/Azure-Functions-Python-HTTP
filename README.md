# Azure Functions + Python HTTP Example Code
*Example code and helper class for Azure Functions (written in Python).*

This example code is designed to demonstrate how to use Azure Functions with Python for HTTP Triggers. It demonstrates:

* Receiving GET (Query String) data
* Receiving POST data
* Sending HTTP Response Status Codes
* Sending body response data
* Sending arbitrary HTTP response headers
* Viewing all system environmental variables

Included is a simple HTTP Helper Class to parse the input data. This should make code changes easier when the Azure Functions team introduce a new interface for Python.
